                    erene is here to help. This is the place where you can get motivated and feel better about yourself. Serene is a website where people can sign up and share motivational quotes for other people to read them and help them get through hard times in life. Once you sign up an account is going to be created for you and you will be able to see every other post(quote) from other users as well. The idea for this website came from considering how people in different stages of their lives often struggle to get through. That is why, our main goal was to find a way to help them, and what a better way than hearing and reading encouraging and motivational words to help cheer up.
